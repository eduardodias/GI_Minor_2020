# This is Excercise 1 for the practical assignment to learn python for API´s prepared by the Spatial Information Laboratory - Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam

# Since we want to be able to get data out of the luchtmeetnet we first we import the request module (which we already did for you) 
# documentation on the request module : http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

import requests


# In order to understand how the luchtmeetnet API works, we you to go through the following steps. 
# Step 1: First we need to find the URL with which we can access the API and get to the different data nodes. Go to https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1562017/RVnbBxf9 and search for the right URL.
# Add this URL to a get request. Put this request in the line below:


# Step 2: In order to access the various data nodes we now want you to create a python dictionary from the response by reading the API output. You probably noticed the API generates json output so make sure to read json. 
# Write your line(s) of code below:


# Now that the API is added to a dictionary you can explore the response using the variable explorer of Spyder or by printing it out to console.
# Step 3: In this step we want you to save the first location to a variable and print it out the the console.



# Step 4: Now go through th dictionary and select a station that is within Amsterdam (or any other city you prefer).
# Save location name and station number to variables and print them out to console.
# Write your line(s) of code below:



# Now that we isolated one station we want you to get specific air quality measurements from that station. 
# Step 5: In order to do so we want you to request the data of your chosen station and create a python dictionary.
# Hint: you need to specify the station number in the URL. In order to see how that is done please check the API documentation (https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1562017/RVnbBxf9) for an example.
# Now use the variable for the station number created just before.
# Write your line(s) of code below:



# Step 6: Since we, as Geo Information students, are interested in locations we want you to save:
# 1. the description
# 2. the chemical compounds which are measured at this station
# 3. the location (coordinates) to variables 
# print the results.
# Write your line(s) of code below:
